## ✅ What's Done

- **850 files** (198MB) uploaded to `Sagar007Rana/sea-crew-manager`
- Dockerfile configured for port 7860
- README.md created with YAML configuration header
- All production code deployed
- **Configuration error FIXED** - Added required YAML frontmatter to README.md

## 🔧 Configuration Fixed

I've added the required YAML metadata to README.md:
```yaml
---
title: SeaCrewManager
emoji: 🚢
colorFrom: blue
colorTo: indigo
sdk: docker
pinned: false
app_port: 7860
---
```

This tells Hugging Face that your Space uses Docker and runs on port 7860.

## ✅ Environment Variables Already Set

All 10 environment variables are configured correctly in your Space settings.

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Refresh your Space page**: https://huggingface.co/spaces/Sagar007Rana/sea-crew-manager
2. The configuration error should now be resolved
3. The Space should start building automatically
4. Wait 3-5 minutes for the build to complete
5. Your website will be live!

**The configuration is now complete!** Your Space should rebuild and go live. 🚀
